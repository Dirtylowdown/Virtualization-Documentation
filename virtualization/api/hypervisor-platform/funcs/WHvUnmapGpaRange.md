# WHvUnmapGpaRange

## Syntax
```C
HRESULT
WINAPI
WHvUnmapGpaRange(
    _In_ WHV_PARTITION_HANDLE Partition,
    _In_ WHV_GUEST_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS GuestAddress,
    _In_ UINT64 SizeInBytes
    );
```
### Parameters

`Partition`

Handle to the partition object

`GuestAddress`

Specifies the start address of the region in the VMâ€™s physical address space that is unmapped

`SizeInBytes`

Specifies the number of bytes that are to be unmapped

## Remarks

Unmapping a previously mapped GPA range makes the memory range unavailable to the partition. Any further access by a virtual processor to the range will result in a memory access exit.
