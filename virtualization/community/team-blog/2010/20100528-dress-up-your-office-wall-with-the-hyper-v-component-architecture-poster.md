# Dress up your office wall with the Hyper-V component architecture poster

Hi, this is Bryon Surace again.  I’m a senior program manager on the Windows virtualization team at Microsoft. 

 

I wanted to draw your attention to the new [Hyper-V Component Architecture Poster](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh849639(v=ws.11)).   

[Hyper-V Component Architecture Poster](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh849639(v=ws.11))

The poster is a great visual tool to help in the understanding of the key features and components of the Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 R2.  It highlights key Hyper-V components including:

§  Architecture

§  Virtual Networking 

§  Virtual Machine Snapshots 

§  Live Migration

§  Storage Interfaces

§  Storage Types

§  Storage Location and Paths

§  Import and Export

 

This large-format poster provides practical visual depictions of the Windows Hypervisor, live migration process, cluster shared volumes architecture, VMQ data paths, disk storage I/O path, and much more.

 

Download, Print, and Enjoy!
