# VDI reference architecture with HP and Citrix

At [HP's Tech Forum conference](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/ "HP Tech Forum website"), HP started to market a VDI reference architecture, and deployment offer, with us and Citrix. The VDI offer can be seen [here](https://www.citrix.com/global-partners/microsoft/ "VDI offer site"). The nuts and bolts of the architecture includes: 

* HP ProLiant BL460c server blades
* HP StorageWorks P4800 SAN
* HP Insight Control for System Center
* Citrix XenDesktop 4.0 enterprise edition
* Hyper-V R2

There are new HP infrastructure services for VDI to help you get started. HP's Dave Donatelli spoke of this VDI architecture (and more) toward the end of his keynote today. It starts around 1:08:00 of Donatelli's keynote.
