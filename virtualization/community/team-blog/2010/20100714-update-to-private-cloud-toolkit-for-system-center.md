# Update to private cloud toolkit for System Center

Back in February we started working with partners and TAP customers on a toolkit to create private cloud environment.  See our [February blog](https://blogs.technet.com/b/ddcalliance/archive/2010/02/16/dynamic-infrastructure-toolkit-for-system-center-dit-sc-sneak-peek-into-on-boarding.aspx) about the Dynamic Infrastructure Toolkit for System Center.

A couple updates were announced Monday at our Worldwide Partner Conference. First, the tool has a new name: [System Center Virtual Machine Manager Self-Service Portal 2.0](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/system-center-blog/the-system-center-virtual-machine-manager-self-service-portal-2/ba-p/342250) (the portal). Second, we reached the release candidate milestone. You can download it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/). _A release candidate milestone means it ’s feature complete, and is nearing completion._ We expect the portal to be finalized and released to the web in calendar Q4.

You can read more about the self-service portal tool over at the System Center team blog ([here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/system-center-blog/the-system-center-virtual-machine-manager-self-service-portal-2/ba-p/342250 "System Center team blog about SCVMM SSP")). Here's an excerpt:

_The self-service portal provides the following features that are exposed through a web-based user interface:_

  * _**Configuration and allocation of datacenter resources:** Store management and configuration information related to compute, network and storage resources as assets in the VMMSSP database._
  * _**Customization of virtual machine actions:** Provide a simple web-based interface to extend the default virtual machine actions; for example, you can add scripts that interact with Storage Area Networks for rapid deployment of virtual machines._
  * _**Business unit on-boarding:** Standardized forms and a simple workflow for registering and approving or rejecting business units to enroll in the portal._
  * _**Infrastructure request and change management:** Standardized forms and human-driven workflow that results in reducing the time needed to provision infrastructures in your environment._
  * _**Self-Service provisioning:** Supports bulk creation of virtual machines on provisioned infrastructure through the web-based interface.Helps business units to manage their virtual machines based on delegated roles_
