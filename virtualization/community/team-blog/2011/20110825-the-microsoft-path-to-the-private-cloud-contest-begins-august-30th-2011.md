# The Microsoft Path to the Private Cloud Contest - Begins August 30th, 2011!

**Your  opportunity to win one of two Xbox 360 4GB Kinect Game Console Bundles!**

Starting next week on August 30th at 9:00 a.m. PST, we’re kicking off our  
Microsoft Path to the Private Cloud Contest. During the contest you’ll have the  
opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of Microsoft virtualization, systems  
management and private cloud offerings by being the first to provide the  
correct answers to three questions posted daily on the [Microsoft Server and Cloud Platform blog](http://bit.ly/o1zBkP).
