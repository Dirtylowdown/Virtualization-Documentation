# More on virtualizing SharePoint

Since there was interest in the [previous post](https://blogs.technet.com/virtualization/archive/2009/04/06/Series-on-virtualizing-SharePoint.aspx "TechNet blog post") about the UK services team's series on virtualizing SharePoint, I wanted to recommend the following video from October 2008. The interview is with Michael Noel of Convergent Computing.  Michael is also a SharePoint MVP. In this video (6 minutes long), Michael talks about using System Center Virtual Machine Manager to deploy SharePoint.  He also talks about disaster recovery and quickly provisioning a SharePoint farm.

There's a high interest amongst our customers to adopt SharePoint, and to run it within a virtual machine. Mark at Enterprise Strategy Group his blog shared the following data with me [from a Dec 2008 research brief by ESG], that partially explains why there's interest.

 

> _In a recent survey of 1,191 IT and business managers, ESG found that one in three (33%) North American and Western European midmarket and enterprise companies are currently using Microsoft ’s SharePoint suite of collaboration and content management tools. __As adoption becomes more widespread, SharePoint is quickly becoming an organization-wide, critical business resource. As shown in Figure 1, 29% of current SharePoint users rate the implementation of SharePoint as one of their top three IT initiatives over the past 12-24 months and 82% place it in their top ten initiatives._
> 
> _ESG ’s research also reveals that SharePoint is viewed very favorably by current users, with 69% of current adopters saying they would recommend that organizations similar to their own implement SharePoint broadly._

  

BTW \- for those of you who read this blog on the Web (20-25% of you), I hope you like the new skins. Patrick
