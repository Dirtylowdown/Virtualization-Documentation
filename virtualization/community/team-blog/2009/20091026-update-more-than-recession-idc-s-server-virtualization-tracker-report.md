# Update; More than recession; IDC's server virtualization tracker report

**Update** : The folks at IDC asked that I remove this blog post until further notice. That said, do check out Roger Johnson's [post](https://i.dell.com/sites/content/business/solutions/operating-systems/en/Documents/crutchfield-case-study.pdf "Roger Johnson's blog post"). He discusses Dell PowerEdge R910 and his Hyper-V deployment at Crutchfield. I met Roger at VMworld 2009. He's a VCP, having run an ESX Server-based datacenter for some time before [Crutchfield](https://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Case_Study_Detail.aspx?casestudyid=4000005133 "Microsoft case study on Crutchfield") moved away from VMware and onto Hyper-V/SCVMM earlier this year.
