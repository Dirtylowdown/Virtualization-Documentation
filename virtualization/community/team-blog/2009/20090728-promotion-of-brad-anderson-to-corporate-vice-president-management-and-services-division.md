# Promotion of Brad Anderson to Corporate Vice President
It comes as no surprise to the regular readers of this blog, that a key tenant of Microsoft’s virtualization strategy is that customers should be able to manage their physical and virtual IT resources from the same set of easy to use tools.  It seems that customers agree, as demonstrated through the growth of the Microsoft Management and Services Division (30% growth year over year) offerings during some challenging economic times.

 

[Today we’ve announced that Brad Anderson](https://blogs.technet.com/systemcenter/archive/2009/07/28/brad-anderson-promoted-to-corporate-vice-president-of-management-and-services-division.aspx "Brad Anderson promotion to CVP"), one of the key drivers behind Microsoft’s management offerings, including the System Center suite and products such as VMM, has been promoted to corporate vice president.  We wanted to share the news with those of you that have worked with or met him over the years through events such as the annual Microsoft Management Summit conference.  Congratulations Brad!
