# Top 10 VMWare myths video

Edwin and David recently sat down in front of a video camera to talk about the top 10 myths from VMWare. Here's a quick outline of the topics discussed during the 11 minute video: 

  * Live migration
  * clustered shared volumes
  * Hyper-V scalability
  * Hyper-V performance
  * Hyper-V footprint
  * Hardware support
  * Memory overcommit
  * End-to-end management
  * Value
  * Why pay VMWare's virtualization tax?
