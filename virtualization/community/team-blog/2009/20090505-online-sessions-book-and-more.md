# Online sessions, book and more

Admittedly this post is a stew and not a meal (if that metaphor works). But you might be interested in the following items. I'll keep it short: 

  * John Kelbley will host a webcast on Friday, May 8 at 8:00am PDT titled, "Running Linux on Hyper-V." The session will discuss install, configure, run, backup and monitor non-Windows systems. 
  * On May 14, 8am-noon PDT, Edwin Yuen will host a live chat on TechTarget. He'll answer questions about our virt products, be it datacenter, desktop or managemment.
  * Wondering what to read when you're flying to TechEd, or your next trip? The Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V Resource Kit book is it. One of the authors, Robert Larson, architect in MS Services and [TechNet blogger](/archive/blogs/roblarson/ "Robert Larson blog"), told me that the book is in final formatting and some sample chapters are available to download. The book will be available via Amazon and Barnes and Noble in June. 
  * Finally 

Enjoy. 

Patrick
