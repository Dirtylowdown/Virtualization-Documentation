# Check out the Visual Studio Team System blog

Many of you will be interested to learn more about forthcoming lab management capabilities in Visual Studio Team System 2010. Or you may have lunch or meetings with a dev who _you_ _want_ to know more about VSTS 2010 Lab Management. That last part is a nod to ["that darn reality" post](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2481968/that-darn-reality-.html "ComputerWorld's sharktank") at SharkTank. So check the [VSTS Lab Management team blog](/archive/blogs/lab_management/ "VSTS Lab Management team blog").
