# XenDesktop 7 Supports Windows Server 2012

We are excited to see the release of XenDesktop 7 and support our partner Citrix. XenDesktop 7 brings together both XenApp and XenDesktop functionality into a common release and now brings support for Windows Server 2012.  XenDesktop can easily be deployed on Hyper-V and take full advantage of Windows Server 2012 to increase agility, reduce cost, and provide a scalable and robust platform for desktop virtualization.
