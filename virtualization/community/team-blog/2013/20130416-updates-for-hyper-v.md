# Updates for Hyper-V

A new article has appeared on the TechNet Wiki that provides a complete list of updates for Hyper-V on Windows Server 2012: <https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/15576.hyper-v-update-list-for-windows-server-2012.aspx> I am really happy to see this online, as we have received lots of positive feedback about how useful the existing documentation is for updates that are available for Hyper-V on [Windows Server 2008 R2](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1349.hyper-v-update-list-for-windows-server-2008-r2.aspx "https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1349.hyper-v-update-list-for-windows-server-2008-r2.aspx") and on [Windows Server 2008](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd430893\(WS.10\).aspx "https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd430893\(WS.10\).aspx").Â  Hopefully this will help everyone in planning and managing their Hyper-V deployments. 

Cheers,
