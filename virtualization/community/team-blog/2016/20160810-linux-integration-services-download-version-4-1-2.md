# Linux Integration Services download Version 4.1.2

We are pleased to announce the availability of Linux Integration Services (LIS) 4.1.2. This point release of the LIS download expands supported releases to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Oracle Linux with Red Hat Compatible Kernel 6.8. This release also includes upstream bug fixes and performance improvements not included in previous LIS downloads. See the separate PDF file "Linux Integration Services v4-1c.pdf" for more information. The LIS download is an optional way to get Linux Integration Services updates for certain versions of Linux. To determine if you want to download LIS refer to the blog post ["Which Linux Integration Services should I use in my Linux VMs?"](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/virtualization/which-linux-integration-services-should-i-use-in-my-linux-vms/ba-p/382304) **Download Location** The Linux Integration Services download is available either as a disk image (ISO) or gzipped tar file. The disk image can be attached to a virtual machine, or the tar file can upload and expanded to install these kernel modules. Refer to the instruction PDF available separately from the download named "Linux Integration Services v4-1c.pdf". **Linux Integration Services documentation** See also the TechNet article “Linux and FreeBSD Virtual Machines on Hyper-V” for a comparison of LIS features and best practices for use [here](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/Supported-Linux-and-FreeBSD-virtual-machines-for-Hyper-V-on-Windows) **Source Code** Linux Integration Services code is open source released under the GNU Public License version 2 (GPLv2) and is freely available at the LIS GitHub project [here](https://github.com/LIS) and in the upstream Linux kernel [here](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/)
