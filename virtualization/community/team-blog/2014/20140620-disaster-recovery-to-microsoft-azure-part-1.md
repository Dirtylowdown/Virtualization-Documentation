# Disaster Recovery to Microsoft Azure - PArt 1

Drum roll please! 

We are super excited to announce the availability of the preview bits of [**Azure Site Recovery**](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery/) **(ASR)** which enables you to replicate Hyper-V VMs to Microsoft Azure for business continuity and disaster recovery purposes. 

You can now protect, replicate, and failover VMs directly to Microsoft Azure – our guarantee remains that whether you enable Disaster Recovery across On-Premise Enterprise Private Clouds or directly to Azure, your virtualized workloads will be recovered **_accurately_ , _consistently_ , _with_ _minimal downtime and with minimal data loss._**

ASR supports Automated Protection and Replication of VMs, customizable Recovery Plans that enable One-Click Recovery, No-Impact Recovery Plan Testing (ensures that you meet your Audit and Compliance requirements), and best-in-class Security and Privacy features that offer maximum resilience to your business critical applications. All this with minimal cost and without the need to invest in a recovery datacenter. To know more about this announcement and what we have enabled in the Preview, check out ****[**Brad Anderson ’s** In the Cloud blog](https://blogs.technet.com/b/in_the_cloud/archive/2014/06/19/announcing-the-preview-of-disaster-recovery-to-azure-using-azure-site-recovery.aspx). 

We will cover this feature in detail in the coming weeks – stay tuned and try out the feature. We love to hear your feedback!
